# CaseClicker
This is the new most recent version of CaseClicker. It comes with a modded version and new cases and other things. You can find the latest link for the project under the repositories description.

This might also be considered the new 'official' version of CSGO-CaseClicker because the other one hasn't had an update in around 5 years.

If you find any bugs or features that you think I should add, please let me know in the pull request tab (because there isn't an issues tab)
